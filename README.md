INTRODUCTION
============



PREREQUISITES
=============

This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC-6 or a Library TS 1 & 2 implementing compiler
  * Boost

BUILDING
========

This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

INSTALLING
==========

Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".

CONTRIBUTING
============

This project has been created with strict following of the Google C++ Style Guide, available at: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml. Please follow the coding style. In some cases (commonly when subclassing external files) the files may follow a different coding style as defined by the project. In such cases, follow the style of the file to maintain consistency.
